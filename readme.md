# Silly C++

A set of my silly C++ experiments while learning and building stuff.
I break stuff and face memory issues and do all kinds of stupid things that might break system, cause UB, memory leak and stuff.

### 🤔 Why do this ?

Why not ? I like to learn about how computers work, how memory works and similar low level stuff. C++ gives me low level memory control so I can
do as I like 😝!
